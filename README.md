# %scrai

`%scrai` is a prototype for AI features on Urbit.

- Connect to a running LLM by providing an API key.
- Read files from Clay and include them in LLM queries.
- Have the LLM generate actions to run on your ship (with your approval).

## Philosophy

It makes significantly more sense to implement Owen Barnes' ["Future of Apps"](https://youtu.be/QU0Ml0ihds0?si=oVQFYv-yuuGK3_jR&t=3258) concept on Urbit—a deterministic system made up of protocols with well-defined actions—than it does to try and train an image-recognition model to control a cursor on your desktop.
